    "cold_start": "The base image has NO models pre-installed. On first cold start, ComfyUI-LTXVideo custom node will be installed, but the LTX-Video model weights (~3.5GB) must be downloaded. This means the first request will have a very long cold start (5-10+ minutes). See README.md for alternatives to reduce cold start time.",
    "model_download": "The workflow uses LoadLTXVideoCheckpoint which downloads from HuggingFace on first use. For production, consider: (1) a custom Docker image with models baked in, (2) a Network Volume with pre-downloaded models, or (3) the COMFY_CUSTOM_NODES env var to auto-install nodes.",
    "cost": "RTX 4090 serverless: ~$0.00031/sec ($1.12/hr). With idle_timeout=5s and min_workers=0, you only pay when processing."
